- What is Machine learning?
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

- What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and information-technology operations which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

- What are container technology and 𝐎𝐒-𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧?
Container technology is a method of packaging an application so it can be run with isolated dependencies, and they have fundamentally altered the development of software today due to their compartmentalization of a computer system.
OS-level virtualization refers to an operating system paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances.

- What is MLOps? How it's important?
MLOps is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production of ML lifecycle. MLOps is the only way to scale machine learning into production.
There are a number of barriers that prevent organizations from successfully implementing ML across the enterprise, including difficulties with Deployment and automation, Reproducibility of models and predictions, Diagnostics, Governance, regulatory compliance, Scalability, Collaboration, and Business uses. A standard practice, such as MLOps takes into account each of the aforementioned areas, which can help enterprises optimize workflows and avoid issues during implementation.

- The aim is to automate a machine learning architecture and to predict only if accuracy is more than 90%. If accuracy is less than 90%, then it will tweak the machine learning model architecture automatically. Jenkins will be checking GitHub repositories every second for any changes. So as soon as a developer commits and pushes, Jenkins will start its jobs.
- Tech n Tools: ML libraries(TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, etc) to create a prediction model and Docker image for further automation, Jenkins(a great DevOps tool for automation), Docker for OS-level virtualization(to create images and containers on RHEL8), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, VMware(to run RHEL8 on our host operating system).


𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
(1) Install VMware on your host operating system. In VMware install the RHEL8 operating system. In RHEL8 install Docker(first you have to install all the requirements of Linux and configure yum and then install docker on RHEL8)
(2) After completion of the docker installation on Linux, create a docker image for the machine learning model to run and predict using a container. So make a directory and create a Dockerfile inside that directory and then use the docker build command to create the required image. (it will download and install everything) Command: docker build -t mlopsimg:v1 .

(3) after the creation of the image install Jenkins on RHEL8 and start Jenkins services. Jenkins needs java to start services, so install java first. After installation, start Jenkins and copy-paste the IP of Linux on the browser with port 8080(Jenkins work on the port 8080) to access Jenkins GUI. example: 192.162.152.123:8080
- sudo yum install jenkins java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel   
- sudo yum install jenkins 
- sudo systemctl start jenkins

(4) Now create account on github and make a repository. Give anyname, i have given Project-MLops. Also make a folder in your windows or any os where you are working on machine learning code and paste all the required files in the same folder so that we can connect it with our github repository and push our updated work when ever we want.
